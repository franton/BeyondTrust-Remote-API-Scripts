# BeyondTrust-Remote-API-Scripts

A collection of handy scripts to run via an MDM for BeyondTrust Remote Support.

The scripts have placeholder variables for the API credentials. These are not meant to have these values baked in, but instead to utilise some other secure method (e.g. Hashicorp Vault) for secure credential retreival.
